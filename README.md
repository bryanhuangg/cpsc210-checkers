<h2>Basic Checkers Game</h2>
<h5> CPSC 210 Project - Bryan Huang </h5>

<em>Introduction:</em>
<br>
Hello and welcome to my CPSC 210 personal project! My application will simulate the
popular board game <em>"Checkers"</em> onto IntelliJ with the power of Java. Hopefully
2 bored friends somewhere out there will use my app to pass time (or to find out which of them 
is the superior checkers player).

I'm quite interested in making an application that simulates checkers as I personally really enjoy
play board games, and think it would be a manageable project for me to do!
